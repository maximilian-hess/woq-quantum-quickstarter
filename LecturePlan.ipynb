    "# Lecture plan: Quantum Quickstarter for industry\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present the lecture structure for the \"Quantum quickstarter for industry\"! This is a lecture geared towards industry professionals to make their business quantum ready. Here, we assume a technical audience with background knowledge in Linear Algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lecture is to show industry professionals potential applications of quantum computing in their business geared towards optimization. We focus on an example usecase of a Knapsack formulation for a packaging usecase and conclude with a homework assignment on a traveling salesperson instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Welcome to the lecture \"Quantum quickstarter for industry\", the lecture for industry education on Quantum. In the next 50 Minutes we would like to introduce you as industry profesionalls to the World of Quantum. \n",
    "To this end we formulated the following Learning goals\n",
    "- Understand and evaluate the potential applications and usecases of Quantum\n",
    "- Map real life optimization problems in your business to a Quantum Algorithm\n",
    "- Get to know Qiskit as a powerful tool to build and execute quantum algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "First we start with a brief introduction and Overview, then we go to a consise theory part followed by a learning exercise in the field of optimization that will be solved together ending with a discussion. Lastly, we hand out a homework assigment testing their learnings for another use case. We finish with an outlook to give a perspective on the World of Quantum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing (QC) is a computational plattform that gained public attention in the last 5 years. QC can potentially solve certain computational problems (e.g. selected optimization problems) a lot faster and more accurate than classical computers. How to find these certain problems and how to formulate them in order to run them on a QC will be the focus of this course.\n"
